# PostService
This is the Post Service used for the Circline project, developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework. It provides essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user posts and leverages MongoDB as the database for efficient and flexible data storage.
This service follows a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Additionally, it is containerized using Docker, and its Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub for seamless deployment and integration within the overall system.
